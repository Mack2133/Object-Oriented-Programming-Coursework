# Shopping-Cart-Manegement-System-With-GUI-(Java-Swing)

### Object-Oriented Concepts Utilized in this Project

- Abstraction: The system abstracts away complex implementation details, allowing users to interact with simplified interfaces.
- Encapsulation: The internal workings of the system are encapsulated within classes, providing a clear boundary for data and functionality.
- Polymorphism: Different classes can be used interchangeably through common interfaces, enabling flexibility and extensibility.
- Inheritance: Classes inherit properties and behaviors from parent classes, facilitating code reuse and organization.

### Java Swing for Graphical User Interface (GUI)

The project utilizes Java Swing to create an intuitive and visually appealing graphical user interface, enhancing user experience and interaction with the shopping cart management system.

### Class Diagram and Use Case Diagrams 

The project includes detailed class diagrams and use case diagrams to illustrate the structure and functionality of the shopping cart management system, aiding in understanding and development.
